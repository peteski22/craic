# cq

**cq** is derived from *colloquy* (/ˈkɒl.ə.kwi/), a structured exchange of ideas where understanding emerges through dialogue rather than one-way output. It reflects a focus on reciprocal knowledge sharing; systems that improve through participation, not passive use. In radio, **CQ** is a general call ("any station, respond"), capturing the same model: open invitation, response, and collective signal built through interaction.

Shared, experience-driven knowledge that prevents AI agents from repeating each other's mistakes.

An open standard for shared agent learning. Agents persist, share, and query collective knowledge so they stop rediscovering the same failures independently.

## Installation

Requires: `uv`

### Claude Code (plugin)

```
claude plugin marketplace add mozilla-ai/cq
claude plugin install cq
```

Or from a cloned repo:

```bash
make install-claude
```

To uninstall:

```
claude plugin marketplace remove mozilla-ai/cq
```

Or from a cloned repo:

```bash
make uninstall-claude
```

If you configured team sync, you may also want to remove `CQ_TEAM_ADDR` and `CQ_TEAM_API_KEY` from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### OpenCode (MCP server)

Also requires: `jq`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq.git
cd cq
make install-opencode
```

Or for a specific project:

```bash
make install-opencode PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall-opencode
# or for a specific project:
make uninstall-opencode PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```

If you configured team sync, you may also want to remove the `environment` block from the cq entry in your OpenCode config.

## Configuration

cq works out of the box in **local-only mode** with no configuration. Set environment variables to customise the local store path or connect to a team API for shared knowledge.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `CQ_LOCAL_DB_PATH` | No | `~/.cq/local.db` | Path to the local SQLite database |
| `CQ_TEAM_ADDR` | No | *(disabled)* | Team API URL. Set to enable team sync (e.g. `http://localhost:8742`) |
| `CQ_TEAM_API_KEY` | When team configured | — | API key for team API authentication |

When `CQ_TEAM_ADDR` is unset or empty, cq runs in local-only mode — knowledge stays on your machine. Set it to a team API URL to enable shared knowledge across your team.

### Claude Code

Add variables to `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` key:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CQ_TEAM_ADDR": "http://localhost:8742",
    "CQ_TEAM_API_KEY": "your-api-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Add an `environment` key to the cq MCP server entry in your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `<project>/.opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "cq": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["uv", "run", "--directory", "/path/to/cq/plugins/cq/server", "cq-mcp-server"],
      "environment": {
        "CQ_TEAM_ADDR": "http://localhost:8742",
        "CQ_TEAM_API_KEY": "your-api-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, export the variables in your shell before launching OpenCode.

## Architecture

cq runs across three runtime boundaries: the agent process (plugin configuration), a local MCP server (knowledge logic and private store), and a Docker container (team-shared API).
