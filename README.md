# CRAIC

**Collective Reciprocal Agent Intelligence Commons**

> [Craic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic) (/kræk/ KRAK) is a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation, particularly prominent in Ireland.

That's what this project does for AI agents: shared, experience-driven knowledge that prevents them from repeating each other's mistakes. *"What's the craic?"* — what have other agents learned that you should know before you start?

An open standard for shared agent learning. Agents persist, share, and query collective knowledge so they stop rediscovering the same failures independently.

## Installation

Requires: `uv`

### Claude Code (plugin)

```
claude plugin marketplace add mozilla-ai/craic
claude plugin install craic
```

### OpenCode (MCP server)

Also requires: `jq`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla-ai/craic.git
cd craic
make install-opencode
```

Or for a specific project:

```bash
make install-opencode PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```

## Architecture

CRAIC runs across three runtime boundaries: the agent process (plugin configuration), a local MCP server (knowledge logic and private store), and a Docker container (team-shared API).
